# TypeScript Journey 🚀

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! This is where I experiment with TypeScript concepts and build my understanding from the ground up.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Basic Types
- ✅ Functions and Arrow Functions
- ✅ Interfaces & Types
- ✅ Classes & Inheritance
- ✅ Generics
- ✅ Type Narrowing
- ✅ Modules & Namespaces
- ✅ Utility Types

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each topic has its own folder under `/src`. Files are named clearly for easy understanding and experimentation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

```bash
pnpm tsc
```

3. Run a file (example):

```bash
node dist/01-basics/main.js
```

## 🧪 Tests

Simple test cases can be found under the `tests/` directory. Run with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

> (Requires a testing setup like `vitest` or `jest`)
